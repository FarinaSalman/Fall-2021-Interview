## About The Challenge

There are two parts to the challenge this year - [a front-end challenge](/FRONTEND) and a [back-end challenge](/BACKEND). You only need to do **one** of them. Both challenges are designed to check you ability to apply technologies in the real world by building a functional application. Please note that we are only looking for effort, and that the challenge result is just a part of our discussion with you during the interview so don't worry if your solution is hacky or even if it doesn't work, submit it anyways, we want to see it!

For the front-end challenge, you are tasked to build a *waste wizard* that allows users to search through a list of househould garbage items to figure our how those items should be disposed and have the ability to place the item in a collection called *waste room* that sorts the item in different bins.

For the back-end challenge, you are tasked to build an API for a social media app for DIYers. The API has endpoints for creating, managing and fetching DIY recipes and managing user data.

You are allowed to use any technology you prefer for both challenges, with the only caveat being the end result for the front-end challenge must run on a browser. You can use any framework, library you like for both challenges.

The challenge is due **January 25th, 2021 @ 1:00 AM EST**. Your submission can be done via GitHub pull request or GitHub issues, more details about submission can be found in the individual challenge README files.

Good luck and have fun!
